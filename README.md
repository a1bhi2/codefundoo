<h1>PWIT</h1>
<br>
Peace With Intelligent Technology
<p>PWIT is a webpage working with the public weather and geostatical API's that predicts how much safe your surrounding gonna be.</p>

<b>How it is gonna work</b>
<p>First we collect weather information from APIs that will be updated regularly with the real time data.</p>
<p>Next we collect ritcher scale data for the world by various APIs.</p>
<p>Then by the help of an intelligent algorithim we predict how much that place is gonna be safe on the scale of 1 to 10</p>

<b>How it is look like</b>
<p>A simple cleanse look make PWIT more attractive and interactive on the top there is drop down menu from which you can select the region scalaable to a town<br> After that there are three circles showing temprature and humidity, earthquake potential and safety rating</p>
<p>It will also include a world map in which safety rating is color coded </p>

<p> PWIT will be simple aiming to beware common people about their surrounding who don't have access and understanding to difficcult technical information about hazards data</p>
